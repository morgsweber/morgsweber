Hello guys :) 

I'm a Computer Technician and a Computer Science undergraduate at PUCRS. Right now, I'm working as a Software Engineer Intern at Poatek, working with C#, .NET, React and Javascript, and in the past I worked for a short time as a back-end developer with PHP, MySQL and Javascript at isDesign Softwares. Here I share some college works and personal projects.
