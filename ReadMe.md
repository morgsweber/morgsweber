Hello guys :) 

I'm a Computer Technician. 
At the moment, I'm a Computer Science student at PUCRS and I'm a Software Engineer Intern at Poatek, working with C#, .NET, React and Javascript. Before this, I worked for a short time as a back-end developer with PHP, MySQL and Javascript at isDesign Softwares. Here I share some college works and personal projects.
